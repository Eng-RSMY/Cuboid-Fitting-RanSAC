# Cuboid-Fitting-RanSAC
RanSaC based cuboid fitting heuristic

Run:
  Use runme.m to execute the program.

  Two 3D point-clouds are included:       
    /3D Point Data/Box.mat
    /3D Point Data/Box_other.mat
    
  In runme.m these point-clouds are used as examples.
  
  In runme.m Load your 3D data in this format:
    X - x-coordiantes of point data, row vector\\
    Y - y-coordiantes of point data, row vector\\
    Z - z-coordiantes of point data, row vector\\
